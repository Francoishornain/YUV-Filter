# YUV FILTER


"YUV Filter - Software" contains the soft version of the filter.

"YUV Filter - Hardware" contains every hard version of every block. It is the final version of the filter.

There are two overlay versions for the complete design:

    -"yuv_filter_full.bit" and "yuv_filter_full.hwh" work without hierarchy.

    -"yuv_filter.bit" and "yuv_filter.hwh" work with hierarchy.
