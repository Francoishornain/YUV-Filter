# YUV-Filter

## How to make a python yuv filter and create custom bloc design on Vivado and Vivado HLS

This repository contains the creation of custom ips of the different functions of the yuv filter:

"RGB2YUV" is about the rgb to yuv conversion.

"SCALE_YUV" is about the scale transformation.

"YUV2RGB" is about the yuv to rgb conversion.

"YUV Filter" contains the filter that does the full image processing with two different ways (SOFT part and HARD part).



Images used for this system are all in the directory "images".
